## Introduction
BrainAgeNeXt is a deep learning model designed to predict brain age with high accuracy across different MRI scanning conditions. The model builds on the MedNeXt framework, inspired by the ConvNeXt blocks.

## Installation
To get started install all requirements of the [MedNeXt repository](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/MedNeXt).
