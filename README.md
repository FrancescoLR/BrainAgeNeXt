# BrainAgeNeXt: Advancing Brain Age Modeling for Individuals with Multiple Sclerosis

Welcome to [BrainAgeNeXt](https://doi.org/10.1162/imag_a_00487), a novel deep learning approach to predict brain age from T1-weighted MRI scans acquired at *any* magnetic field strength.

### UPDATE: A demo of BrainAgeNeXt is available here:

## Introduction
BrainAgeNeXt is a deep learning model designed to predict brain age with high accuracy across different MRI scanning conditions. The model builds on the MedNeXt framework [2], inspired by the ConvNeXt blocks [3].

## Installation
### Create and activate a new conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n brainage python=3.11
conda activate brainage
```

### Clone our MedNeXt repository and install all packages:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FrancescoLR/MedNeXt.git
cd MedNeXt/
pip install -e .
```

### Download the models and the inference script:
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/FrancescoLR/BrainAgeNeXt
```


## Usage
First, preprocess all images by performing skull stripping on the T1-weighted MRI scans (SynthSeg from Freesurfer is the preferred tool), followed by an affine registration to the MNI 152 standard space and an N4 bias field correction using ANTs.
### Run the inference script to predict brain age on your data:

```bash
cd BrainAgeNeXt
python BrainAge_estimation.py csv_file.csv
```

where the csv file has columns Path and Age with the full path to the pre-processed nifti files and their relative chronological age.
